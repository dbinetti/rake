Your yard has been chosen to be raked by Rake Up Eagle,
sponsored by the Eagle Middle School PTO.  We had an
overwhelming response by volunteers and are so grateful
for the many willing hearts and hands in Eagle!

Volunteers are scheduled to arrive at your property the
morning of Saturday, November 14th, between 9AM and Noon.
They will knock upon arrival but must stay outside your home.
Volunteers bring their own bags, rakes, and gloves; all filled
leaf bags will be placed for normal pickup on your designated
garbage day.

Please be sure to clean up any dog waste prior to our
arrival and keep any pets inside while volunteers are at your home.

If you have any questions please contact Michelle Erekson
by phone/text at 319-541-1111 or emailÂ emerekson@gmail.com.
We look forward to seeing you on Saturday, November 14th!
