Thank you so much for volunteering for Rake Up Eagle!

Two quick things:

First, we posted some pictures from the event on the Rake Up Eagle
website so check them out at www.rakeupeagle.com.

Second, please answer these questions so we can improve next year:

- How many bags did you actually use?
- How many hours did you work in total?
- How many adults/children were in your group?

We'd also love to hear any other comments, particularly
on how we can make this even better!


Thank you so much -- all our recipients were so grateful!
